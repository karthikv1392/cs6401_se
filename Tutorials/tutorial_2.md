### Some clarifications made during the tutorial
1. Only UML class diagrams are required. You only need to look at classes from the `core`, `web` and `web-common` folders.
2. You don't need to show every single class in the diagram. Only show the classes that are relevant to the subsystem. Use your judgement and state any assumptions.
3. You can omit getters and setters and such methods from the diagram. Write this in your assumptions. 
4. You don't need to go into fine grained detail for all the exceptions thrown. 
5. For the LLM pipeline, you are free to use any LLM API. This question is more open ended. You can choose to include metrics you've gotten from Sonarqube or CodeMR for detecting design smells.
6. The LLM pipeline can be written in any language. Use any tools you like. Submit the code in the same repository in a separate folder.
