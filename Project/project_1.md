# CS6.401 Software Engineering 
## Spring 2025

## Project - 1


---

Welcome to the first project of the CS6.401. Software Engineering course. Your objective in this project is to apply the concepts you have learned (and will learn) in the class to improve an existing software system. You will reverse engineer the design of the system and refactor it following grounded software engineering principles. You will use some tools to analyze the code and collect metrics to aid this process.

Rudra's Subscription Service (RSS) Reader, a web-based [RSS](https://rss.com/blog/how-do-rss-feeds-work/) aggregator and reader will serve as the testing ground for the project. The app can be used to organize your feeds. You can find the repository and install instructions after accepting the assignment [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/51CAWZT5). The first person of your team will create a repo with your team number released on Moodle and the others will join the same team. We will use a class-specific fork which has been slightly streamlined for ease of use. Think about what design pattern RSS vs email newsletters follow ðŸ¤” (or don't, it's not graded.)

_Note: When using Large Language Models (LLMs) or other AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude etc. in completing this assignment, kindly include screenshots delineating the specific prompts employed and the corresponding generated responses. Additionally, provide an evaluation of the accuracy of these responses, highlighting instances of correctness or errors. Furthermore, mention any novel contributions or modifications introduced by you during the utilization of LLMs in addressing the task._

### Task 1 (30)

Welcome to the better way of reading articles! Rudra personally visits the websites you've asked him to and gets the latest articles for you to enjoy. Let's have a look at what he's offering and what you're going to do:

The major subsystems of the app are as follows:



1. _Subscription and Content Subsystem_:
    This is where new feed is added to the reader. The feed can be fetched from a URL or imported via a Google Takeout ZIP or OPML format file. You can also export your subscriptions to an xml. The system also displays the 10 most recent articles when you add a new feed. Now that you've added a feed, you can read the articles from it or follow the link to the original site. The system only supports RSS feed formats.



2. _Feed Organization Subsystem_: 
    Now that you have a lot of feeds and articles to comb through, you want some way to order them. Rudra has provided you with the ability to star articles, mark them as read and organize them into folders. You can also share these articles through Facebook, Twitter and Email. You can also search for articles based on their name/content (its quite primitive though). 


3. _User Management Subsystem_: 
    Self-explanatory. The Rudra (the admin) can add, delete and update users. Users can also change their password. 


Task Description:



* **Identify Relevant Classes**: Examine the provided RSS Reader codebase and discern the classes responsible for the specified features (Subscription and Content, Feed Organization, and User Management).
* **Document Functionality and Behavior**: For each identified class, create detailed documentation elucidating its functionality and behavior in the context of the corresponding subsystem.
* **Create UML Diagrams**: Utilize Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, association, composition and aggregation to model the relationships and interactions between the identified classes accurately. Employ UML class diagrams to visually represent the structure, relationships, and attributes of the identified classes. Ensure that the level of abstraction chosen is appropriate for conveying a clear and concise representation of the system. **_Please note that you have to use plantUML or starUML as the tool for creating UML diagrams. Hand-drawn diagrams or diagrams drawn using tools such as draw.io, lucidchart etc. will not be considered for grading even if they are syntactically accurate._**
* **Observations and Comments**: Include observations and comments in your documentation, highlighting points of strength and weakness within the system.
* **Assumptions**: If simplifying assumptions are made during the documentation process, explicitly state these assumptions in your report.

### Task 2(30)

#### Task 2a

Design smells are structures and patterns in code that while not incorrect, are indicative of violating fundamental design principles. These can hinder development by leading to recurring problems down the line and should be avoided.  


Many automated tools exist to identify these. Sonarqube being a very popular one (though it detects code smells, you need to infer the design smells). We also have Designite Java and other plugins are available on different IDEs. We encourage you to use multiple tools as well as manually inspect the code, but Sonarqube is a must. To get started with Sonarqube, follow this [documentation](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/try-out-sonarqube/).

Sonarqube identifies _code_ smells in a given repository. Code smells are closely related to design smells, but are more specific in nature. Make sure that you list design smells, not code smells.

_Note: Sonarqube or any automated tool is not perfect, so use your own judgment. The best way to identify design smells is to first make the UML class diagram for the project and try to justify design choices, or identify if better ones could have been made._ 

Task Description: 

Detect 5-7 design smells using the tools mentioned above, and support your analysis for each design smell with either the code smells provided by Sonarqube or the analysis performed by using other tools.

PS - Sonarqube and the project itself require different Java versions to run. Instructions for handling this are provided in the project README. You may need to use the oldest supported version of Sonarqube. Also, docker is your friend here.

#### Task 2b

The goal of this task is to conduct a comprehensive code metrics analysis for the initial state of the project, utilizing appropriate tools such as CodeMR, Checkstyle, PMD, or any other tools deemed suitable. The analysis should provide insights into up to 6 key code metrics, and the implications of these metrics should be discussed. Additionally, consider how these metrics might guide decision-making processes for potential refactoring. Ensure that the metrics you select are diverse, and also include OOPs specific metrics (like those of Chidamber and Kemerer).

Task Description:



* **Code Metrics Analysis**: Employ code analysis tools (e.g., CodeMR, Checkstyle, PMD) to extract up to 6 relevant code metrics for the project. These metrics may include but are not limited to: Cyclomatic Complexity, Code Duplication, NPathComplexity, Lines of Code and so on.
* **Tools Used**: Clearly state the tools used for the code metrics analysis and ensure that the selected tools provide a reliable and accurate representation of the project's codebase.
* **Implications Discussion**: For each identified metric, discuss its implications in the context of software quality, maintainability, and potential performance issues. Provide insights into how each metric reflects on the project's current state.

### Task 3 Refactoring (40)

Having gained a comprehensive understanding of our system's organization and performance, it's time to roll up our sleeves. In the preceding task, we have pinpointed various metrics and design smells within the repository, shedding light on code quality and functionality. With ample room for enhancement, the final step in this phase involves addressing these issues. Ideally, you would run tests both before and after refactoring to ensure no functionality has changed, but this code is so smelly that its tests don't pass ðŸ‘Œ.

#### Task 3a Design Smells

You previously identified 5-7 design smells. Now, the goal is to rectify these issues through code refactoring without fundamentally altering the existing codebase. It's crucial to emphasize that we're not discarding the previous code but rather enhancing its design. **_The refactoring should go beyond trivial changes, and your evaluation will be based on the correctness and significance of the improvements made. Trivial changes refer to changes more fine-grained than the class level, like defining variables for repeated constants, wrapping something around a try-catch block, repeatedly extracting methods and so on. The goal is for your refactoring to address the design smell you've identified._**

_Important Note: Whenever you're tweaking the code to fix a design issue, make it a habit to kick off the process by opening a new issue on GitHub. This helps us keep a neat record of all the changes we're making in the codebase. **Your performance will be evaluated only based on the issues you create**, so it's a crucial step before diving into the problem-solving part. Think of it as maintaining a clear roadmap for the improvements you're making._

#### Task 3b Code Metrics

Following the refactoring process, it's time to reassess the metrics measured earlier. Have they seen improvements or deterioration? Is the trend consistent across all metrics, and does it align with your expectations? Additionally, analyze the factors contributing to these changes. Have all code metrics improved? Is that even possible ðŸ¤¨??

#### Task 3c Leveraging Large Language Models for Refactoring

In the era of advanced language models like GPT4o and Claude, we have powerful tools at our disposal that can assist in the refactoring process. As an additional step to this assignment, you will use these LLMs to generate alternative refactored versions of the identified code snippets for 2-3 design smells.

Task Description:



* **Identify Code Snippets**: Select specific code snippets corresponding to the design smells identified in Task 2a.
* **Apply Manual Refactoring**: Before using LLMs, you should manually refactor the selected code snippets based on your understanding of design principles and best practices.
* **LLM Refactoring**: Use an LLM to generate alternative refactored versions of the same code snippets. Provide screenshots or links to the conversation to show the LLMâ€™s output. Compare the LLM-generated refactoring with the manually refactored version in terms of clarity, conciseness, and adherence to best practices.
* **Evaluate and Document**: Document the differences between the manual and LLM-generated refactored versions.  
Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, considering factors such as code readability, maintainability, and efficiency. Explore scenarios where LLMs excel and where manual intervention is still preferable.

_Note: Keep in mind, you only have to document the changes in the code suggested by LLMs and not apply it in your actual code base. The code base should only contain changes made by you._

#### Task 3d Automating Refactoring Pipeline

In this task you will design and implement a pipeline that utilizes Language Models (LLMs) to periodically detect design smells in a GitHub repository, automatically refactor the identified issues, and generate a pull request for the changes. 

You are expected to use OpenAI/Gemini/comparable APIs for this task. OpenAI provides 5$ worth of free API usage to every user, and Gemini offers free API usage with a rate limit. See respective websites for more info.

Task Description:



* **Automated Design Smell Detection**: Develop a script or tool that periodically scans the GitHub repository for design smells. This can include metrics analysis, code pattern recognition, or any other relevant approach.

    Utilize the capabilities of LLMs to assist in identifying potential design issues in the codebase.

* **Automated Refactoring**: Implement an automated refactoring module that takes the identified design smells and generates refactored code using LLMs.  
Ensure that the refactoring process is robust, preserving the functionality of the code while enhancing its design.

* **Pull Request Generation**: Design a mechanism to automatically create a pull request with the refactored code changes.  
Include detailed information in the pull request, such as the detected design smells, the applied refactoring techniques, and any relevant metrics.

You can also provide additional diagrams such as flowcharts to explain your approach better.

Try to have at least 2 files included in context to address design smells and not just code smells. If the file is too big to fit in context, consider using Gemini or a single file.

### Bonus (5)
Now that you've made the automated refactoring pipeline, let's do some evaluations. Use at least 2 different LLMs to compare the design smell identification capability and refactoring capabilities. Use at least 2 design smells to compare the results. Do they identify the same smells you have? Do they suggest the same refactoring? Are some models good at identifying smells but bad at refactoring and vice-versa? This task is open ended, feel free to do as much as you want, but the minimum requirement is to compare the performance of 2 LLMs for 2 design smells.  


_Note: This bonus will only recoup marks lost in this project. It will not add to your course total, i.e. your project 1 marks will be min(100, project marks + bonus)._



### **Submission Instructions**

The submission for this phase will be through the GitHub classroom. The codebase will be automatically downloaded at the deadline, so ensure that everything is up in time. No exceptions will be granted.

In addition to the code changes required, you also need to submit a report containing your responses for each task. The report should be present in the docs directory, titled project1_&lt;team_number>.pdf. If you are attempting the bonus, submit a separate document titled project1_bonus_&lt;team_number>.pdf containing the corresponding responses. Add these reports and other documents in the `docs/` folder of your repository.

Accurately report the contribution of each team member at the end of the report. This will be considered when evaluating the project.

Soft deadline - 11th February, 2025

Hard deadline - 18th February, 2025

**_Note: Bonus can be submitted till the hard deadline without any penalty. Late days are not applicable for bonus components_**

The course policy mentioned on this website will be followed for late submissions and associated penalties/late days.

**Best of luck (start early)!**
