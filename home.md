## About

This course will provide an overview of the principles and foundations of modern software engineering techniques (primarily design based). Topics include software modelling, refactoring, design patterns and software architecture with a focus on application of these concepts to concrete software problems. Credit where its due, the course structure was initially designed by [Dr. Raghu Reddy](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~raghu.reddy/Home.html).


## Lecture hours

The lectures will be in-person and will held on every [Tuesday and Friday 5:00 PM to 6:

## Resources

### Useful textbooks:

  1. UML@classroom: An Introduction to Object-Oriented Modeling by Martina Seidl, Marion Scholz, Christian Huemer and Gerti Kappel
  2. M. Fowler. Refactoring: Improving the design of existing Code, 2000. Addison Wesley. ISBN 0-201-48567-2.
  3. Design Patterns Elements of Reusable Object Oriented Software by Enrich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides
  4. Software Architecture in Practice (Third/Fourth edition) by Len Bass, Paul Clements and Rick Kazman, Addison-Wesley.

### Useful tools:

  1. UML - There are plenty of UML tools available such as StarUML, MagicDraw, etc. As far as this course is concerned it would be more than enough to use an open source UML tools such as: [Eclipse Papyrus UML](https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/) or [Gaphor](https://gaphor.org/). If you prefer text based modelling then [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) can be an excellent choice. *Please don't make use of any normal diagramming tools for this course*.

  2. Java/Python IDE - This course will involve development in Java/Python. There are many IDEs for Java/Python available. We suggest to either use [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) or [Intellij IDEA Community edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download) for Java and [Intellij PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for Python.
